### Networking Basics for Cybersecurity


**Introduction:**
Networking is one of the foundations of cybersecurity, serving as a strong backbone for protecting systems and data. To secure networks effectively, you need to understand how devices communicate, how data moves, and how attackers exploit weaknesses.
In this guide, we’ll cover essential networking concepts every cybersecurity professional should know—from IP addresses and protocols to firewalls and security tools. So buckle up, and let’s get started!


Let's start from the basics.

## What is networking?
A computer network is a system that compromises of interconnected computing device that faciliate communication and enable resource sharing.
 These networks can range from a small home network connecting devices like your laptop and mobile phone to large-scale networks spanning multiple geographical locations. 

## The Importance of Networking in Cybersecurity
While networking allows seamless communication and data exchange, it also intrduces security risks. Cyber attackers exploit vulnerabilities in network configurations, weak protocols, and unprotected data flows to gain unauthorized access, steal infromation, or launch attacks like Ddos and man-in-the-middle attacks. 
For cybersecurity professionals, understanding networking is essential for identifying threats, securing data, and implementing defense strategies. From configuring firewalls and monitoring network traffic to detecting suspicious activities, a solid grasp of networking fundamentals is crucial for protecting digital assets in today's connected world. 

## Understanding Networking MOdels: OSI vs. TCP/IP
To effectively analyze and secure networks, cybersecurity professionals must understand how data moves between devices. The OSI model and the TCP/IP model serve as fundamental frameworks for how network communication works. 

## The OSI Model: The 7-Layer Framework 
The OSI(Open system interconnection) model represents an easy and intuitive way to standardize the different parts required to communication across networks. 
The OSI model breaks down network communication into **seven layers**, each with a specific role: 
- 1. Physical Layer : Deals with raw data transmission(cables, radio signals, etc.)
- 2. Data Link Layer : Manages direct node-to-node data transfer and MAC addresses.
- 3. Network Layer : Handles IP addressing and routing (e.g. determining the best path for data.)
- 4. Transport Layer : Ensures reliable data transmission(TCP for reliability, UDP for speed).
- 5. Session Layer : Manages sessions and connections between applications.
- 6. Presentation Layer : Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.
- 7. Application Layer: Interfaces with end-user applications.

Each layer interacts with the one above and below it, ensuring structured communication between devices.
