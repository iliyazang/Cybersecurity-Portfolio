## 1. File and Directory Management
Understanding file structure and permissions is crucial for investigating security breaches. So today we are going to learn how to work with files. 

### Key Commands
- `ls` — List files and directories
- `rm` — Remove files or directories
- `mkdir` / `rmdir` — Create or delete directories
- `cd` — Change directory
- `pwd` — Display the current directory path

**Example: Creating and Managing Directories with `mkdir`**
Suppose you're organizing log files for a security audit. Here's how you can create a dedicated folder for investigation data:

```bash
# creating a directory for security audits
mkdir security_audit 
cd security_audit 
pwd 
 
```
Output: `/home/user/security_audit`

Here's a visual representation in action: 



By understanding these foundational commands, you'll streamline your investigations and improve file organization -- critical skills for cybersecurity analysis.
